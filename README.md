### Who We Are

We're a team of dedicated data scientists, healthcare professionals, and software engineers based in West London. Working with Brompton Health PCN,we're united by one mission: to modernise the way primary care is delivered and make healthcare more efficient for everyone involved.

### Our Inspiration

The NHS faces an annual cost of approximately ¬£1 billion due to missed appointments, commonly known as DNAs (Did Not Attends). These DNAs not only drain resources but also extend wait times for other patients who could have used those slots. With a staggering 4% DNA rate among 140,000 patients in our primary care network alone, we decided it was time for a change.

### The Problem We're Solving

While the issue of DNAs has gained some attention, most existing predictive models are focused on secondary care. This leaves primary care‚Äîthe frontline of healthcare‚Äîunderrepresented in data-driven solutions. Moreover, telephone appointments are often not counted, concealing the true scale of the issue.

## **Our Solution: Show Up for Health**

### Cutting-Edge Technology

Our app harnesses the power of deep learning to predict the likelihood of DNAs in primary care appointments. We're not just looking at past attendance records; we're also integrating variables like health indicators, local weather conditions, index of multiple deprivation and more, to give healthcare providers a more holistic understanding of patient behaviour.

### Features

- **Deep Learning Algorithms**: Trained on a rich dataset that captures the multi-dimensionality of healthcare delivery.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: We provide real-time analytics in a simple, intuitive dashboard accessible via any web browser.
- **Dynamic Updates**: As more data is collected, our algorithms adapt and improve, ensuring the most accurate predictions possible.

### Who Can Benefit

- **Healthcare Providers**: Optimise your appointment scheduling and reduce overhead costs.
- **Patients**: Benefit from more timely healthcare delivery, as reducing DNAs means quicker access to healthcare providers.
- **NHS**: A reduction in DNAs could save millions, if not billions, redirecting funds to where they're needed most.

## **Join Us**

We invite you to be part of this revolutionary journey. Whether you're a healthcare provider in the Brompton Health PCN, or a curious individual interested in the future of healthcare, we want to hear from you.
