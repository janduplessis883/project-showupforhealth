## Overview

We aim to reduce the £1 billion annual cost of missed appointments (DNAs) in the UK's NHS by developing a predictive model focused on primary care. Based in West London's Brompton Health PCN, we're tackling a 4% DNA rate among 140,000 patients.

## The Problem

Despite its impact, the majority of predictive research on DNAs focuses on secondary care. Moreover, telephone appointments are often not counted, potentially underrepresenting the true scale of the issue.

## Objective 🎯

Utilize deep learning to predict the likelihood of primary care appointment DNAs. We'll be using features like health indicators and weather conditions to help healthcare providers optimize patient management.
## Features 🔍

- Electronic Frailty Index: Assesses patient vulnerability.
- Obesity, Depression, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Serious Mental Illness, Non-Diabetic Hyper Glycaemia
- IMD 2023: Socioeconomic status score.
- Distance from Surgery/Station: Accessibility factors.
- Booking Method: Clinician-booked or patient-booked.
- Length of Registration: Duration of patient's association with the healthcare center.
- Weather Conditions: Temperature and precipitation.
- Historical No-shows: Previous missed appointments.

## Evaluation Metrics 📊

- Recall: To correctly identify actual no-shows.
- AUC: To gauge model's discriminative power.
