### Introduction: Predicting Missed Appointments in Primary Care at Brompton Health PCN

The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) is a behemoth in the healthcare sector, providing primary, secondary, and tertiary care to millions of residents. With this vast reach and immense responsibility, efficient resource utilization is crucial. One aspect of resource allocation that has attracted attention over the years is missed appointments, colloquially known as "Did Not Attend" (DNA) events. These DNAs are reported to cost the NHS approximately Â£1 billion annually, a substantial figure that has the potential to be reduced with the right interventions.

Situated in West London, Brompton Health Primary Care Network (PCN) is an amalgamation of 12 individual NHS GP Practices. Serving a considerable patient population of 140,000 individuals, this PCN experiences a DNA rate of 4% for face-to-face (F2F) appointments. Notably, while these figures pertain to F2F interactions, telephone appointments are typically not coded as missed, which might mean the true cost and extent of DNAs is potentially underrepresented.

Despite the significance of DNAs in primary care, much of the machine learning research in predicting missed appointments has focused on secondary care data. This presents an opportunity: can we harness the power of data science and machine learning to better predict, and thus mitigate, DNAs in a primary care setting like Brompton Health PCN?

This project aims to bridge this gap. Leveraging patient data, we intend to develop a predictive model to identify patients at risk of missing their appointments. By doing so, we hope to provide healthcare practitioners with a tool that allows for timely interventions, potentially reducing the number of DNAs and the associated costs.

By hosting this project on GitHub, we invite collaboration, scrutiny, and iterative improvement. Together, we can work towards a more efficient NHS and better patient care.
